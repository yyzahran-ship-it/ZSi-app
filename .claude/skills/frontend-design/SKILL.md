# Frontend Design Skill

Eight anchors. Each is a distinct aesthetic territory locked to specific CSS tokens. Pick one per brief. Match its tokens.

> **Reach for the unexpected. Fidelity to the anchor. Discipline on the content. Nothing left to default.**

---

## 1. How to work

Before writing code, run this sequence:

1. **Context** — Identify purpose, audience, domain, content density. State the problem in one sentence.
2. **Anchor** — Pick one. Lean unexpected. A Swiss punk record label, an Industrial florist, a Brutalist luxury watchmaker, an Aurora tax app, a Chaotic law firm, a Retro-Futuristic wedding photographer, an Organic trading terminal, a Lo-Fi luxury hotel — each more distinctive than its safe counterpart. Safe pairings produce generic work. Unexpectedness is surface-level — what a first-time viewer sees. Don't let "users are technical" or "it's really a data tool" route every brief to Industrial. State the choice and the reason in one line.
3. **Differentiator** — Define one memorable anchor-internal move: a signature interaction, a typographic gesture, a layout motif, or a material treatment. One sentence. Describable. Visible in the rendered output.
4. **System** — Match the chosen anchor's tokens exactly. Picking Swiss means white + sans + grid, not "some flavor of clean."
5. **Implementation** — Outline structure, then build. Content on screen is authored to the discipline in §2 — no fabrication, no filler, no themed replacement for standard UI copy.

Commit fully to one anchor. Hybridising ("Swiss with Brutalist edge") is a category error — each signature excludes the others by construction.

## 2. Content is not design

Design is visuals — palette, typography, structure, texture. **Content — every string, number, and label on screen — is authored separately and has its own discipline.** Token fidelity is not a defence against content slop.

The rule: every string on screen must either name real information from the product, or be authored content that knows what it is — headline, button label, legal body, form field name, sample data that reads as sample. What's forbidden is content pretending to be something it isn't.

**Forbidden:**

- **Fabrication posing as real data.** Invented session personas (`a.chen@grid.co`), fake telemetry (`GRID.FREQ 59.998 Hz`, `BUILD 8.2.0-rc3`). If a slot has no real content, leave it empty — do not fabricate to make the screen look alive.
- **Filler labels.** Mono-caps subtitles nobody asked for (`SECURE OPERATOR AUTHENTICATION` under a login masthead), `//`-prefixed kickers pretending to be code comments (`// INTELLIGENCE LAYER`). If removing the string removes no information, it was filler.
- **Themed replacement of standard UI copy.** `Authenticate Session` instead of `Next`; `Remember this operator` instead of `Remember me`. Standard copy for standard actions. Themed copy is a tax that must be paid with actual utility.
- **Unicode glyphs as icon substitutes.** `▣ Dashboard`, `◊ Market Navigator`. Either use a real icon set or use nothing. ASCII art is not iconography.
- **AI-slop register.** The model recognises this. Twee subcopy on serious surfaces (`Ask the grid.`), synth-sci-fi status strips on mundane B2B, ornamental "seam"/"joinery" flourishes pretending to be structural. Recognise it in your own output; cut it before the reviewer does.

## 3. The eight anchors

Each anchor locks specific CSS tokens. Picking the anchor commits to those tokens. If the rendered output drifts outside them, the anchor didn't hold.

### 1. Swiss

**Surface:** Pure white `#FFFFFF` or neutral `#F7F7F8`. **Typography:** Akzidenz-Grotesk, Helvetica Neue, or Söhne — sans display and body, one family. **Accent:** Swiss Red `#E4002B`, International Orange `#FF4F00`, or Yves Klein Blue `#002FA7` — one, used deliberately. **Structure:** visible grid lines or 1 px hairline rules. Left-aligned typography; asymmetric balance. Numerals as composition elements (dates, folio numbers, page markers set in condensed sans).

**Breaks if:** warm paper, serif display, grain texture, or centered typography appears.

### 2. Industrial

**Surface:** Pitch black `#000000` or warm-black `#0B0C0A`. **Typography:** IBM Plex Mono, JetBrains Mono, or Berkeley Mono — mono for display and body. **Signal color:** one semantic — green `#00E676`, red `#FF3B30`, amber `#FFB800`, or acid lime `#C6FF4A`. **Structure:** flat; 1 px borders instead of shadows. Tabular numerics via `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.

**Breaks if:** serif typography, proportional fonts, warm paper, any grain, decorative shadows, or rounded corners appear.

### 3. Brutalist

**Surface:** Pure primary or anti-primary — `#FF0000`, `#0000FF`, `#FFFF00`, `#000000`, `#FFFFFF`. Pick 2–3, compete equally. **Typography:** system fonts only — Times New Roman, Helvetica, Courier, Arial, system-ui. Mix faces deliberately. **Shadows:** hard offset, no blur — `box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 #000`. **Controls:** native browser — unstyled `<button>`, default `<select>`, underlined blue links that stay blue. Margins crushed; type runs edge-to-edge.

**Breaks if:** webfonts, tuned hex beyond pure primaries, soft shadows, rounded corners, or centered layout appear.

### 4. Aurora Maximalism

**Surface:** Dark saturated gradient — `linear-gradient` or `conic-gradient` through violet `#5D34D0` → magenta `#FF006E` → cyan `#00F0FF`, or `#3B82F6 → #A855F7 → #EC4899`. **Typography:** Inter Variable, PP Neue Machina, or Sharp Grotesk for oversized display (15–25 vw). **Texture:** mesh gradient as primary surface feature; neon `text-shadow` glow on accents (`0 0 20px <accent>`). **Motion:** spring-physics orchestration, scroll-linked parallax.

**Breaks if:** flat backgrounds, warm paper, restraint, or hairline rules as primary structure appear.

### 5. Chaotic Maximalism

**Surface:** Clashing palette — pastels *and* neons in the same composition. Hot pink `#FF71CE` + acid yellow `#DFFF00` + cyan `#00FFFF` + any third. **Typography:** mixed faces deliberately colliding — 3+ faces from different registers on the same page. **Texture:** patterns on every surface (squiggles, dots, zigzags, checker — SVG or `repeating-linear-gradient`). Oversized display crashing against busy ground.

**Breaks if:** coherent palette, single typeface, whitespace as structural element, or 60/30/10 dominance appears.

### 6. Retro-Futuristic

**Surface:** Pitch black `#0A0014` or deep navy-black. **Typography:** period-specific — VT323 (CRT), Orbitron (synthwave), Space Mono (cyberpunk), Monoton (Miami-neon), Press Start 2P (arcade), IBM Plex Mono (terminal). **Accent:** neon pair — magenta `#FF006E` + cyan `#00FFFF` (synthwave) or phosphor green `#00FF41` + amber `#FFB000` (terminal). **Texture:** CRT scanlines via `::before` `repeating-linear-gradient` overlay, or chromatic aberration (`text-shadow: 2px 0 #FF0000, -2px 0 #00FFFF`), or both. Glow committed.

**Breaks if:** flatness, modern sans-serifs (Inter, Söhne), paper surfaces, or absence of texture appears.

### 7. Organic

**Surface:** Earth tones — sage `#8B9D83`, clay `#B08B6E`, terracotta `#C66B3D`, ochre `#C08E3A`, moss `#606C38`. When a light surface is needed: sand `#E8DCC7` or oat `#D4B895`. **Never cream `#F0-F8` warm-paper range.** **Typography:** humanist serif (Freight, Caslon, Fraunces — Fraunces is restricted to this anchor only) or warm geometric sans (Greycliff, Epilogue, Recoleta). **Structure:** rounded corners 16–32 px. **Texture:** grain at 1–3 % via SVG feTurbulence. **Motion:** gentle ease 300–500 ms, breathing animations on hero elements.

**Breaks if:** cream backgrounds (warm-tinted `#F0+`), cold greys, pure whites, pure blacks, or hard rectangles appear.

### 8. Lo-Fi

**Surface:** Paper-yellow `#E8E0C0` or `#EDE4CF` — more saturated than cream. **Typography:** mixed system fonts on the same page (Times + Helvetica + Courier colliding deliberately). **Structure:** rotated elements (2–8° off-grid via `transform: rotate`). **Texture:** halftone dot transitions (SVG pattern or `radial-gradient` tile) on imagery; Risograph misregistration (2–4 px RGB channel offset via `text-shadow: 3px 0 #FF006E, -3px 0 #00FFCC`). SVG staple, tape, torn-edge elements.

**Breaks if:** precision, single typeface, smooth motion, rectangles squared to the grid, or cream (the surface is specifically paper-yellow, more saturated) appears.

## 4. Output

Every implementation delivers:

- **Stated direction** — A short preamble in a designer's prose before the code, naming: the chosen anchor, why this pairing over the safe one, the differentiator, and the key palette / typefaces / texture choices pulled from the anchor. Written with conviction, not as a checklist.
- **Token fidelity** — The rendered CSS matches the anchor's tokens exactly. If Swiss is chosen, the CSS contains no warm paper, no Fraunces, no grain. If Industrial is chosen, every typeface declared is monospace. Token drift means the anchor didn't hold.
- **Content discipline** — Every string, number, and label on screen names real information or is authored content that knows what it is. No fabricated data, no filler labels, no themed replacement for standard UI copy, no unicode-glyph icons. Token fidelity alone is not sufficient; content ships too.
- **Differentiator visible** — The one memorable move is implemented in the rendered output, not merely described.

---

## 5. Before shipping

- **Unexpected pairing** — Did the choice reach for creative tension, or default to the safe pairing?
- **Token fidelity** — Does every rendered token live inside the anchor's allowed range? If tokens appear that the anchor doesn't allow, the anchor didn't hold.
- **Content discipline** — Every label names real information; standard UI copy for standard actions; no fabrication, filler mono-caps, `//` kickers, unicode-glyph icons, twee subcopy, or AI-slop register. If any appeared, cut.
- **Differentiator visible** — Is the memorable anchor-internal move actually rendered?
- **Hybrid resistance** — Was one anchor held, or did the execution drift into "Swiss with Brutalist edge"?
