# Recipe: Consumer Product — Warm

**Project type:** Consumer app / productivity / creator tool / lifestyle
**Default direction:** VP (Vibrant-Playful)
**Also supports:** EL (editorial-leaning consumer brands like Rhode, Graza), DE (for craft-forward productivity tools like Craft or Linear-early)

### If direction is EL (alternate — editorial consumer)
- Near-white binary palette, single brand accent
- Giant 20vw product name on hero
- Scroll-linked product pin
- Sticky chapter sections for features
- Zero gradient cards; rely on product photography

### If direction is DE (alternate — craft-forward consumer)
- Paper palette with hairline dividers
- Asymmetric hero with mono metadata sidebar
- Micro-interactions everywhere (magnetic buttons, number scramble on stats)
- Replace cinematic hero image with an inline UI preview with live micro-interactions

## Scope

**Use for:**
- Note-taking, reading, journaling apps
- Creative tools (music, video, design-for-civilians)
- Fitness, wellness, lifestyle products
- Personal finance (consumer side)
- Calendar, to-do, habit trackers

**Not for:**
- Developer or B2B software
- Editorial/agency sites (use `editorial-brand.md`)

## Design System

- **Blueprint:** Editorial Warm with selective Spatial Immersive for hero
- **Palette:** Paper Editorial from `core/token-system.md` (warm cream bg, terracotta accent)
- **Accent alternatives:** deep olive, dusty rose, slate indigo — choose based on product voice
- **Typography:** Instrument Serif (display) + Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono used only for timestamps/labels (very sparingly)
- **Motion:** warm, generous — duration 600-900ms, soft easing, no sharp snaps
- **Signature pattern:** a large, cinematic hero image or editorial illustration — this is the one recipe where imagery leads

## Section Order

| # | Section | Job |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Nav | Brand (often serif wordmark) + 3-4 nav links + Download / Sign up |
| 2 | Hero | Large serif headline, generous subhead, single CTA. Hero image dominates: lifestyle photo OR editorial illustration OR a literal in-app screenshot on a device. |
| 3 | FeatureStory | A long-form editorial block — headline + 2 paragraphs + inline image. Reads like magazine writing, not marketing. |
| 4 | FeaturesGrid | Alternating rows with screenshots. Each feature gets a paragraph, not a one-liner. |
| 5 | Quotes | 2–3 user testimonials as pull-quotes in serif italic. Named user + role + city. |
| 6 | Pricing (or Free+Premium) | Simple: Free / Premium ($X/mo). Not 3 tiers. |
| 7 | FAQ | 5 questions. Friendlier tone than B2B — "Does it sync across devices?" |
| 8 | CTABanner | Warm, personal: "Start your 30-day free trial." |
| 9 | Footer | Simpler than B2B: Product / Company / Social / Legal. Often includes a newsletter signup. |

## Voice Cues

- Allowed: first-person user voice ("I finally read more this year"), sensory verbs (write, read, breathe, notice, keep)
- Forbidden: enterprise jargon (synergy, leverage, stakeholders), hyperbolic verbs (supercharge, turbocharge)
- Tone: personal, quiet, specific. Write for a thoughtful reader with a good eye.

## Failure Signals

- ❌ Dark background (this recipe is warm/light by default)
- ❌ Big bold sans-serif hero — should be serif and more editorial
- ❌ 3-col icon card grid anywhere
- ❌ Pricing shows 3 tiers with "Enterprise Contact us" — this is consumer
- ❌ Copy sounds like it was written by a B2B marketer
