"""Gate execution (D9, tasks 4.1-4.3, `establish-the-emission-target-contract`).

**Hook point (proposed, per the lead's invitation to propose rather than guess silently):** a new
`FINAL_STEPS` row, `"plugin-gates"`, appended after `"emission-target"` -- not auto-chained inside
`emit_target.py` itself. Every other checklist step in this pipeline (`build-current-pass`,
`render-capture`, ...) is a distinct command the agent invokes one at a time, never auto-triggered
by the step before it; gate execution follows that same discipline. This still satisfies "gates run
after domain steps complete" (a FINAL step runs only once every setup/pass step is done) and "as
part of the emission-target step's post-run" in the sense that it is the very next thing the
checklist asks for, immediately following target selection -- just not chained in-process.

The runner argv is constructed here in Python (task 4.1) -- reusing `_img2_home()`, no `img2`
binary at runtime -- and mirrors `img2.mjs`'s `gateRunnerArgv` (`bin/img2.mjs:807-809`) exactly: the
file-path form, not the module form §13:308 documents (that drift is recorded, not touched here --
it is task 5.5's). A drift-guard test asserts the two never disagree.

The two-clause participation rule (task 4.2, D9): (i) a plugin's gates run when any step it
contributed to THIS workspace's checklist has run -- via `domain.json` or via a selected target
step; (ii) a plugin that contributed no step runs no gates. Clause (i)'s owner lookup
(`domain_owner_plugin`) is derived from the registry layout (`$IMG2_HOME/plugins/<id>/domain.json`)
rather than assumed from a name match -- see its docstring for the earlier, wrong version this
replaced.

Invocation is through the bounded runner from 3.4 (`emit_target.run_bounded`) -- same bounds as
targets, per D9's amendment. The `img2.gate-run` aggregate envelope is parsed per task 4.3:
malformed -> error, never a pass; status/exit disagreement -> error; a blocking fail stops the
WHOLE run (across every involved plugin, not just that plugin's own gates.json), naming the gate
and the plugin.

    Returns `None` when the profile resolves from an in-repo domain module
    (`forge/_shared/domains/*.py`, e.g. `character` today) instead of an installed plugin -- an
    in-repo domain has no owner plugin, so clause (i) correctly yields "no plugin participated" for
