# Object Image Validation Rubric

Use this reference when the suitability decision is unclear.

## Pass

- one obvious target object
- object occupies enough of the frame
- at least one strong silhouette
- major materials are visible
- hidden side can be reasonably inferred
- target can be approximated with procedural primitives

## Conditional

- one view only but object has rotational symmetry
- some occlusion but macro shape is clear
- fine surface detail can be represented with procedural texture
- target is organic but user accepts stylization
- exact brand/logo/text fidelity is not required

## Reject

- target object is ambiguous
- photo is a scene, not an object reference
- important shape is hidden, cropped, blurred, or transparent
- request demands exact mesh extraction or manufacturing-grade dimensions
- object relies primarily on smoke, liquid, glass caustics, or lace (no reconstruction path exists for these)

## Character / Human Suitability

Do not blanket-reject a subject for being hair- or cloth-fold-dominant. If the form language is character-like (humanoid silhouette, skin/cloth/hair materials), classify it `character-conditional -> stylized` instead of `reject`. Route through `grimoire/character/reconstruction.md` (proportions, landmarks, pose, stylized materials) by default.

- **character-conditional -> stylized**: humanoid subject, at least one clear frontal view, pose readable, hair/cloth is present but the user accepts the stylized-clump/fold-normal treatment rather than photoreal strands or drape simulation. Proceed with the standard character pipeline.
- **character-conditional -> maximum likeness**: user explicitly wants the closest possible match to a specific person/character. Confirm this intent before starting, then route through `grimoire/character/likeness_maximization.md` (projection-first: template fit, camera match, de-lighting, texture projection). State up front that a single image cannot guarantee 100 percent likeness; report per-region confidence instead of claiming an exact match.
- **still reject**: no humanoid silhouette is discernible at all, the figure is fully occluded/cropped below usable proportions, or the request demands photoreal skin/hair microstructure from a single low-resolution image with no willingness to provide more views or accept stylization.

Before committing to a character spec:

- confirm which stylization level the user accepts (realistic ~7.5 heads / stylized 5-6 / chibi 2-3) — do not assume realistic by default
- request front, side, and back (or full-body) views whenever the visible view cannot support pose, proportion, or back-of-head/body inference
- if maximum likeness is requested but only one low-quality view is available, say so explicitly and offer the stylized fallback as the practical alternative

## Ask For Better Input

Ask for:

- front, side, and back views
- a neutral background
- higher resolution
- close-ups of material/detail
- desired style: realistic, stylized, low-poly, game prop, hero render

## Complex Object Detail Standard

For objects with many details, require:

- macro components for the overall mass
- meso components for visible sub-assemblies
- micro components or local features for repeated/tiny details
- material layer stack for every visually distinct surface
- local overrides for stains, scratches, dirt, color changes, wear, bumps, and roughness shifts
- confidence per component or feature
- evidence refs to image regions

If these cannot be inferred from the image, mark the spec `conditional` and list missing views or close-ups.

## Catalogued items: get the real identity before authoring

When an item exists in a catalogue -- a game skin, a product SKU, a model number -- the name in the
image is not the identity. Ask the user for the exact catalogue name up front, and pull the official
and vanilla references BEFORE authoring geometry: they show base-model features the name never
reveals. Never infer stock features from a name alone. A domain plugin that serves such a catalogue
ships the lookup tooling and states the rule in its own contract.
