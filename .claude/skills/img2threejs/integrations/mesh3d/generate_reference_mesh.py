"""
Generate a reference mesh from reference image(s) via a hosted TRELLIS Space, as GLB **and** OBJ.

Why a hosted Space and not a local model: TRELLIS states "the code is currently tested only on
Linux" and "an NVIDIA GPU with at least 16GB of memory is necessary", and its submodules (spconv,
nvdiffrast, diff-gaussian-rasterization, flash-attn) are CUDA-only. There is no MPS path. The Space
runs on the provider's CUDA hardware, so an Apple Silicon machine gets TRELLIS output without
TRELLIS ever running locally.

Why BOTH formats, from one generation:
  GLB  — transport/render format. Three.js loads it natively (GLTFLoader), so the reference can be
         rendered with the SAME camera and shader as the candidate model. That identical-domain
         render is the entire point: comparing a PBR render against a photograph is what pins
         `ssim` at 0 and `tonalParity` at 0.11.
  OBJ  — scoring format. `forge/` gates are pure-stdlib by house rule, and OBJ is `v/vn/f` ASCII
         that a ~30-line stdlib parser reads. Decoding GLB accessors/bufferViews in pure Python is
         200-400 fiddly lines and impossible outright if the file is Draco-compressed.

Both files are written from ONE generation and ONE transform, because the most dangerous failure
here is silent: if the GLB and the OBJ disagree on axis convention, the Three.js render and the
Python metric score two different objects and neither complains. glTF fixes Y-up/right-handed/metres
by spec; OBJ fixes nothing. `--assert-axes` compares their bounding boxes and refuses to continue on
a mismatch.

Texture is deliberately minimal. The metrics this unlocks (Chamfer, F-score, normal consistency) are
geometric, and the depth/normal render path discards materials anyway. A generated texture is a
hallucinated bake of a single view with shading and AO burned in — strictly worse than the original
reference images, which remain the colour authority.

Usage:
